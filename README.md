## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Google API Key 
```
https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
```

```
Python, Node.js, npm 
```

## Installing <a name = "installing"></a>
- Clone project
```
git clone https://github.com/jakubstec/quizzMeAI.git
```

- Change the .env_sample file to .env and paste your Google API Key
```
API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

inside /backend folder
Install necessary packages
```
cd .\quizzMeAI\backend\
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- In app.py, change app.run() to
```
app.run(debug=True)
```
so it refreshes every time you make changes in your code.

- now leave terminal with running server and enter /frontend directory

- there you need to install Vite
```
npm install vite
```
- then run the project

```
npm run dev
```

Everything should be working correctly!
